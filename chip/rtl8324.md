title: RTL8324
---

Realtek RTL8324 is 24\*100Mbit. It implements RRCP protocol, per-port tx/rx counters, vlans and many more features. Note, that
unlike [RTL8326(S)][RTL8326] RTL8324 contain no 802.1Q design flaw. Everything works perfectly.

Here is manufacturer's product description:

Here is datasheet for this chip:

Note, that all RRCP-related information was for some strange reason removed. Practically RRCP works fine, and all
registers seems to be identical as described for [RTL8324P]
