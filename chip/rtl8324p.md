Realtek RTL8324P is 24\*100Mbit. It implements RRCP protocol, per-port tx/rx counters, vlans and many more features. Note, that
unlike [RTL8326(S)][RTL8326] RTL8324P contain no 802.1Q design flaw. Everything works perfectly. There is no
perceptible difference between RTL8324P and [RTL8324], except for no RRCP-related sections in recent versions of
datasheet of later.
